## Image Optimization

Next.js will automatically optimize these images when you use them. For best results:

- Use modern formats (WebP, AVIF) when possible
- Keep file sizes reasonable (< 500KB before optimization)
- Use high-quality source images (they'll be compressed automatically)

## Where images are used

- `hero_image.png` → Hero section (main banner)
- `profile_image.png` → About section (circular profile photo)
